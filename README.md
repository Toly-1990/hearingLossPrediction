We need to develop data mining methods to predict subjects’ hearing thresholds based on gray matter images. The dataset includes the subject’s gray matter images of Brain MRI scans and their associated hearing thresholds at two different pure-tone frequencies. We need to train at least three  different prediction models to predict the hearing thresholds of the subjects at these two 
pure-tone frequencies based on gray matter images, and compare the performance 
of these prediction models using various evaluation metrics and write a technique report to 
discuss their methods and performance study results.
